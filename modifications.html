<ul>
    <li>
        <h2>Assuming someone has followed the instruction for installing the application, how can they make changes?</h2>
        <p>All modifications can be made by editing the source code. If you want to add a new schema to the database, add the sechema to the backend folder in the bsyBackend repository, an entry point to the api folder, and source in vercel.json.</p>
